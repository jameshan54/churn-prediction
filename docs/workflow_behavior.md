## Workflow: Behavior Mapping

### 1. Problem Definition
- Can we segment users based on behavioral logs?

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Sort user actions by timestamp
- Generate behavioral sessions per user

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Number of clicks
- Activity by time of day
- Product category preferences

### 4. Clustering
- Use unsupervised models to segment user behavior

### 5. Visualization
- Plot behavior clusters
- Use PCA or t-SNE for dimensionality reduction
